You have been chosen by Whisks and Things (https://whiskandthings.co.uk/) to audit their newly launched website. To do so, you'll need to complete the following:

1. Generate 2 personas for the website. Be as specific as you can with age, genders, financial status, and reasons for coming to the website. (20 points)

Persona n-1:

- Name: Anna
- Age: 54
- Gender: Female
- Working position: She works as a manager for an events company
- Financial status: £ 42.000 year
- Reason for coming to the website: She wants to order some treat to meet with new clients.

Persona n-2:

- Name: Jhon
- Age: 38
- Gender: Male
- Working position: He runs his own business.
- Financial status: £ 30.000 to 50.000 year
- Reason for coming to the website: he is opening his new shop in South est London and wants to set a buffet for his customer

2. Choose one of the personas and use the 5 second rule. Does the website pass? Explain why or why not.(15 points)

The home page of the website shows a clear image of the product in its hero header, which helps the user to identify what is the website's primary intent easily
The website passed the 5 five-second rule.

3. Using the same persona, what 3 things would you as an observer seek to validate (subject to usability hierarchy) in a usability test? (15 points)

- Visual hirarchy and scale
- User controll and navigation
- Help documentation

4. One of the problems with the website is the navigation doesn't help your persona. Create a navigation wireframe in HTML that serves your persona (20 points)

5. The owner wishes to have a bespoke loading icon. Create a purple square in the middle of your wireframe, and demonstrate the animation principles of easing and arching. (30 points)
